# Essential BBQ Safety Tips Every Griller Should Know

Grilling is one of summer's greatest pleasures, but it comes with responsibilities. Follow these essential safety tips to ensure every BBQ session is both delicious and safe.

## Grill Placement and Setup

### Location Matters
- Place your grill at least **10 feet away** from your house, deck railings, and overhanging branches
- Never grill in a garage, even with the door open
- Ensure the grill is on a **flat, stable surface**
- Keep away from high-traffic areas, especially where children play

### Before You Start
1. Check for propane leaks (use soapy water on connections)
2. Inspect hoses for cracks or damage
3. Ensure all parts are securely attached
4. Clean out old grease and debris from the drip pan

## Fire Safety

### Have These Ready
- **Fire extinguisher** rated for grease fires (Class B)
- **Baking soda** for small grease fires
- **Spray bottle with water** for flare-ups
- **Heat-resistant gloves**

### If a Fire Occurs
1. **Grease fire**: NEVER use water—close the lid and vents
2. **Gas fire**: Turn off the burners if safe to do so
3. **Spreading fire**: Call 911 immediately
4. Move away from the grill

## Food Safety

### Temperature Guidelines

| Food | Safe Internal Temperature |
|------|--------------------------|
| Poultry | 165°F (74°C) |
| Ground meat | 160°F (71°C) |
| Pork | 145°F (63°C) |
| Beef/Lamb steaks | 145°F (63°C) |
| Fish | 145°F (63°C) |

### The Two-Hour Rule
- Don't leave perishable food out for more than **2 hours**
- In hot weather (above 90°F/32°C), reduce to **1 hour**
- Keep cold foods cold and hot foods hot

### Prevent Cross-Contamination
- Use **separate plates** for raw and cooked meat
- Never reuse marinades that touched raw meat
- Wash hands thoroughly between handling raw and cooked food
- Clean utensils between uses

## Gas Grill Safety

### Propane Handling
- Store propane tanks **outdoors** in an upright position
- Never store near heat sources or in direct sunlight
- Transport with windows open
- Check for the **"rotten egg" smell** indicating leaks

### Lighting Procedure
1. Open the lid first
2. Turn on the gas
3. Then ignite the burners
4. Never lean over the grill when lighting

## Charcoal Grill Safety

### Starting the Fire
- Use **chimney starters** instead of lighter fluid
- If using lighter fluid, never add it to hot coals
- Let coals ash over completely before cooking (20-25 minutes)

### Disposing of Coals
- Wait **48 hours** for coals to cool completely
- Soak in water before disposing
- Place in a metal container, never plastic

## Children and Pet Safety

- Establish a **3-foot "kid-free zone"** around the grill
- Never leave a lit grill unattended
- Keep matches and lighters out of reach
- Teach children that the grill stays hot long after cooking

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Opening a gas grill lid while lighting
2. ❌ Using water on grease fires
3. ❌ Leaving grill unattended
4. ❌ Moving a hot grill
5. ❌ Wearing loose clothing while grilling
6. ❌ Not cleaning the grill regularly
7. ❌ Ignoring gas leaks

## Post-Grilling Safety

1. Turn off all burners
2. Close the propane tank valve
3. Let the grill cool with the lid open
4. Clean the grates while still warm
5. Cover the grill once completely cool

## Quick Safety Checklist

Before every grilling session:
