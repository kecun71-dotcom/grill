## Marinating Tips

### Do's
✅ Always marinate in the refrigerator
✅ Use non-reactive containers (glass, plastic, or stainless steel)
✅ Turn meat occasionally for even coverage
✅ Pat meat dry before grilling for better searing

### Don'ts
❌ Don't reuse marinades that touched raw meat
❌ Don't over-marinate delicate proteins (seafood: max 30 min)
❌ Don't use acidic marinades for too long (can make meat mushy)
