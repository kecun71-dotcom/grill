# The Ultimate Guide to Grilling the Perfect Steak

Nothing beats the sizzle of a perfectly grilled steak on a hot summer evening. Whether you're a backyard BBQ beginner or a seasoned grill master, this guide will help you achieve steakhouse-quality results every time.

## Choosing the Right Cut

The foundation of a great steak starts with selecting the right cut:

### Ribeye
- **Flavor**: Rich and beefy, with excellent marbling
- **Best for**: Those who love a juicy, flavorful steak
- **Ideal thickness**: 1-1.5 inches

### New York Strip
- **Flavor**: Beefy with a good fat cap
- **Best for**: Balance of tenderness and flavor
- **Ideal thickness**: 1-1.25 inches

### Filet Mignon
- **Flavor**: Mild and buttery
- **Best for**: Those who prefer tenderness over flavor
- **Ideal thickness**: 1.5-2 inches

## The Perfect Temperature Guide

| Doneness | Internal Temp | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Rare | 120-125°F (49-52°C) | Cool red center |
| Medium-Rare | 130-135°F (54-57°C) | Warm red center |
| Medium | 135-145°F (57-63°C) | Pink center |
| Medium-Well | 145-155°F (63-68°C) | Slightly pink |
| Well-Done | 155°F+ (68°C+) | No pink |

## Essential Grilling Technique

### 1. Bring to Room Temperature
Remove your steak from the refrigerator 30-45 minutes before grilling. This ensures even cooking.

### 2. Season Generously
Keep it simple: coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper. Season both sides liberally.

### 3. Get Your Grill Hot
Preheat your grill to high heat (450-500°F / 230-260°C). A hot grill creates those beautiful sear marks.

### 4. The Two-Zone Method
Create a hot zone for searing and a cooler zone for finishing:
- **Sear**: 2-3 minutes per side on high heat
- **Finish**: Move to indirect heat until desired temperature

### 5. Rest Your Steak
Let your steak rest for 5-10 minutes after grilling. This allows the juices to redistribute.

## Pro Tips from Our AI Chef

1. **Use a meat thermometer** - The most reliable way to achieve perfect doneness
2. **Don't press down** - Resist the urge to press your steak; you'll lose precious juices
3. **Oil the steak, not the grill** - Prevents sticking and promotes better searing
4. **Consider reverse searing** - For thick cuts, start on low heat and finish with a hot sear
