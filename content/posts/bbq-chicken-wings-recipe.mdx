# Crispy BBQ Chicken Wings: The Ultimate Recipe

Chicken wings are a BBQ party staple, and mastering them will make you the hero of any gathering. Here's how to achieve that perfect balance of crispy skin and juicy meat.

## Why These Wings Work

Our recipe combines three key techniques:
1. **Dry brine** - For maximum crispiness
2. **Indirect grilling** - For even cooking
3. **High-heat finish** - For that irresistible char

## Ingredients

For approximately 24 wings (serves 6-8):

- 3 lbs (1.3 kg) chicken wings, tips removed, flats and drums separated
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp paprika

### For the BBQ Sauce Glaze:
- 1 cup (240 ml) your favorite BBQ sauce
- 2 tbsp honey
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 tsp hot sauce (optional)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Day Before (or at least 4 hours ahead)

1. **Pat the wings completely dry** with paper towels
2. **Mix baking powder with seasonings** in a small bowl
3. **Toss wings** with the seasoning mixture until evenly coated
4. **Arrange on a wire rack** over a baking sheet
5. **Refrigerate uncovered** for 4-24 hours

### Grill Day

1. **Preheat your grill** for two-zone cooking:
   - Hot side: 400°F (200°C)
   - Cool side: indirect heat

2. **Start on indirect heat**
   - Place wings on the cool side
   - Close the lid
   - Cook for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway

3. **Check for doneness**
   - Internal temperature should reach 175°F (79°C)
   - Skin should start crisping

4. **Move to direct heat**
   - Transfer wings to the hot side
   - Grill for 3-4 minutes per side
   - Watch carefully to prevent burning

5. **Glaze (optional)**
   - Brush with BBQ sauce in the last 2 minutes
   - Let it caramelize slightly

6. **Toss in sauce**
   - Transfer wings to a large bowl
   - Add remaining sauce
   - Toss to coat evenly

## Pro Tips for Perfect Wings

### Crispier Skin
- The baking powder is essential—it raises the pH and helps break down proteins for crispier skin
- Never skip the overnight dry brine step

### Even Cooking
- Separate flats and drums for more consistent results
- Group similar sizes together on the grill

### Sauce Timing
- For sticky glazed wings: sauce during grilling
- For sauced wings: toss after grilling
- For dry rub lovers: skip the sauce entirely

## Flavor Variations

Transform your wings with these sauce combinations:

| Style | Sauce Mix |
|-------|-----------|
| Classic BBQ | Sweet BBQ + honey |
| Buffalo | Hot sauce + butter |
| Asian | Soy + ginger + garlic |
| Lemon Pepper | Butter + lemon + black pepper |
| Garlic Parmesan | Butter + garlic + parmesan |
