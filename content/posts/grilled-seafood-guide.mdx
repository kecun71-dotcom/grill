## Salmon: The Crowd Pleaser

### Skin-On Technique
1. Pat salmon completely dry
2. Oil the fish, not the grill
3. Place skin-side down first
4. Don't move for 4-5 minutes
5. Flip only once

### Cedar Plank Method
1. Soak plank for 2+ hours
2. Place salmon on plank
3. Grill over indirect heat
4. No flipping needed

## Perfect Grilled Shrimp

### Preparation
- Use large or jumbo shrimp (easier to handle)
- Peel but leave tails on
- Devein for cleaner presentation

### Skewer Tips
- Use two parallel skewers to prevent spinning
- Metal skewers work better than wooden
- Leave small gaps between shrimp

### Marinade Time
- Maximum 30 minutes for acidic marinades
- Longer for oil-based marinades

## Grilled Scallops

### Buying Tips
- Look for "dry" scallops (not treated with phosphates)
- Should smell like the ocean, not fishy
- Size: U-10 means 10 per pound

### Grilling Steps
1. Pat extremely dry (moisture = no sear)
2. Season simply: salt, pepper, olive oil
3. Grill over highest heat
4. 2-3 minutes per side maximum
5. Look for golden crust, opaque center

## Whole Fish on the Grill

### Best Fish for Grilling Whole
- Branzino
- Red snapper
- Trout
- Mackerel

### Technique
1. Score the sides (3-4 diagonal cuts)
2. Stuff cavity with herbs and lemon
3. Oil generously
4. Use a fish basket or heavy-duty foil
5. 10-12 minutes per inch of thickness

## Lobster Tails

### Preparation
1. Cut shell lengthwise on top
2. Lift meat slightly while keeping attached
3. Brush with garlic butter

### Grilling
1. Start shell-side down (5 minutes)
2. Flip and baste with butter
3. Cook until opaque (3-4 more minutes)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Not Preheating
Seafood needs a hot, clean grill to prevent sticking.

### 2. Moving Too Soon
Let the protein release naturally before flipping.

### 3. Overcooking
Seafood cooks fast—use a timer!

### 4. Not Drying
Moisture is the enemy of a good sear.

### 5. Too Much Marinade
Pat off excess before grilling.

## Essential Sauces for Grilled Seafood

| Sauce | Best With |
|-------|-----------|
| Lemon butter | Lobster, scallops |
| Chimichurri | Shrimp, swordfish |
| Mango salsa | Salmon, mahi-mahi |
